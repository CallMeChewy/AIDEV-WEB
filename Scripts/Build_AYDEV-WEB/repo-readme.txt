A comprehensive framework demonstrating optimal AI-human collaboration, manifested through the development of practical applications that themselves leverage AI capabilities.

## Project Vision

Project Himalaya aims to create a comprehensive framework for AI-human collaborative development while building practical applications like the OllamaModelEditor. The project follows a layered architecture with a focus on documentation-driven development and knowledge persistence.

### Key Features

- üìö **Documentation-Driven Development**: Documentation precedes implementation
- üß© **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with no module exceeding 500 lines
- üîÑ **Knowledge Persistence**: Mechanisms for maintaining context across development sessions
- üß™ **Systematic Testing**: Comprehensive testing integrated from the beginning
- ü§ù **AI-Human Collaboration**: Optimized workflow between human creativity and AI capabilities

## Project Structure

Project Himalaya follows a layered architecture:

### Layer 1: Core Infrastructure
- **DocumentManager**: Document storage and retrieval with metadata
- **StateManager**: Session state persistence and context management
- **StandardsValidator**: Validation against AIDEV-PascalCase and other standards

### Layer 2: Communication Framework
- **TaskManager**: Task definition and tracking
- **AIInterface**: Communication with cloud and local AI systems
- **KnowledgeTransfer**: Knowledge packaging and transfer

### Layer 3: Development Tools
- **CodeGenerator**: Standards-compliant code generation
- **TestFramework**: Test case creation and execution
- **DocumentationGenerator**: Automated documentation creation

### Layer 4: Applications
- **OllamaModelEditor**: Tool for customizing and optimizing Ollama AI models
- **AIDEV-Deploy**: File deployment with validation and rollback

## Current Status

The project is currently in the foundation phase, focusing on Layer 1 components. The DocumentManager component is the current priority.

## Documentation

Project documentation is available at our website: [projecthimalaya.com](https://projecthimalaya.com)

| 10     | Vision & Scope | Project vision, scope definition, roadmap |
| 20     | Standards | Coding standards, design principles, documentation standards |
| 30     | Templates | Reusable document templates for various purposes |
| 40     | Knowledge Organization | Database structure, metadata standards, taxonomy |
| 50     | Implementation | Implementation plans and details for active components |
| 60     | Testing | Test plans, test cases, testing frameworks |
| 70     | Documentation | User guides, API documentation, tutorials |

## Development Process

We follow a documentation-driven, bottom-up development approach:

1. Create comprehensive component specification
2. Define interfaces and data models
3. Implement unit tests
4. Develop the component
5. Document implementation details
6. Integrate with other components
